# LogicDesginDrawingApp
In the Spring of my Sophomore year, I made drawing program for my Logic Design class.  The program was written using Verilog, a hardware description language, and it ran on an Altera FPGA board.  (Some code for displaying the output of the board a VGA display was provided by the University of Toronto and was not included here.)
